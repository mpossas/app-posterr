## Planning

### Questions for the Product Manager

1. Can I reply to my own posts?
2. Can I reply a reply?
3. Do replies count towards the daily post limit?

### How I would solve this problem

- Create a "Reply" component to display the "Replying to @username"
- Assuming I can reply a reply, add a "reply" action, indicated by a comment icon, to the "Post" and "Reply" components.
- Assuming a user cannot reply to their own posts, the post actions are already hidden for them.
- The "reply" action opens a modal similar to the quote-post, showing a text-area and the original post, but the "Post" button would display "Reply" and save a new post of type "reply".
- Create a new service to filter posts by a user ID and "post" and "reply" types. These posts would appear in the new "Posts and Replies" feed.
- Adjust the other services that return posts to ignore "reply" type posts.
- Assuming replies count towards the daily post limit, they would already be counted.

## Critique

If I had more time, I would have just downloaded the icons I use instead of the entire fontawesome-free library. I would have also added unit tests to the project.

If this project were to grow, I believe the daily limit of five posts would be an obstacle. It would have to at least disregard reposts.

In a real-life situation, I would use Vuex to implement state management for the application. It provides a more structured and decoupled access to data.

I would also use NuxtJS for SSR. The service layer, that mutates data from the back-end, would be handled by a server with superior computing power.

We could also break down the feed and user profile into microfrontends, each handling their own responsibilities.

Thinking about maintenance, we could add unit tests (Jest) and E2E (TestCaf√©) to ensure the code is working, and add logs (Sentry) to monitor the health of the application.

The content could also be cached by a CDN (Amazon CloudFront), providing faster content loading for the user.
